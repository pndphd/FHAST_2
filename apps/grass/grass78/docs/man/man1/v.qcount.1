.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIv.qcount\fR computes six different quadrat count statistics that provide
a measure of how much an user defined point pattern departs from a complete
spatial random point pattern.
.PP
Points are distributed following a complete spatial randomness (CSR) pattern
if events are equally likely to occur anywhere within an area. There are two
types departure from a CSR: regularity and clustering. Figure 1 gives an example
of a complete random, regular and a clustered pattern.
.br
\fIFigure 1: Realization of two\-dimensional Poisson processes of 50 points on
the unit square exhibiting (a) complete spatial randomness, (b) regularity, and
(c) clustering.\fR
.PP
Various indices and statistics measure departure from CSR. The
\fIv.qcount\fR function implements six different \fIquadrat count\fR
indices that are described in Cressie (1991; p. 590\-591)[1] and in Ripley (1981;
p. 102\-106)[2] and summarized in Table 1.
.br
\fITable 1: Indices for Quadrat Count Data. Adapted from
Cressie [1], this table shows the statistics computed for the
quadrats in Figure 2.\fR
.PP
These indices are computed as follows: \fIv.qcount\fR chooses
\fBnquadrads\fR circular quadrats of radius \fBradius\fR such that they are
completely within the bounds of the current region and no two quadrats overlap.
The number of points falling within each quadrat are counted and indices are
calculated to estimate the departure of point locations from complete spatial
randomness. This is illustrated in Figure 2.
.br
\fIFigure 2: Randomly placed quadrats (n = 100) with 584 sample points.\fR
.PP
The number of points is written as category to the \fBoutput\fR map (and not
to an attribute table).
.SH NOTES
This program may not work properly with lat\-long data. It uses
\fIhypot()\fR in two files: \fIcount.c\fR and
\fIfindquads.c\fR.
