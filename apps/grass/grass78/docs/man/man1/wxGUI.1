.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwxGUI\fR is a native \fIGraphical User Interface\fR (GUI) for
GRASS GIS. Its main features include displaying geographical data
in 2D and 3D, calling GRASS GIS modules, and interacting with data.
.SS Overview
The GUI is composed of \fIthree\fR main components:
.RS 4n
.IP \(bu 4n
The \fBLayer Manager\fR includes map layer management, integrated
command\-line prompt, and command output window tab.
.IP \(bu 4n
The \fBMap Display Window\fR integrates basic tools for
zooming, panning, data querying, and map elements (north arrows,
barscale, etc.). Each display window is associated with its own
set of map layers in the layer manager. The user may start multiple map
displays during a session. The map layers for each display are grouped
under different tabs in the Layer Manager.
.IP \(bu 4n
Module dialogs enable running GRASS modules.

.SS Layer Manager
The \fILayer Manager\fR provides an interactive graphical interface for
creating and managing GRASS displays. There is a toolbar to manage displayed
map layers, a layer tree frame in which map layers for display are organized,
a command output window tab, and interactive command line prompt. On Linux
and Windows platforms, the layer manager also has a menu bar with a set of
pull\-down menus for all GRASS GIS functions (analysis, file I/O, GIS
configuration and management); on a Mac, the GRASS functions menu is at the
top of the screen.
.br
.br

Figure: Layer Manager screenshot on Ubuntu
.PP
The top left button of the toolbar opens a new \fIMap Display
Window\fR. Each map display has a unique set of layers to display
and region settings. Other toolbar buttons add layers of different
types for display in the selected map display window. There are
additional buttons for saving or opening workspace file, and others.
.PP
Map layers are listed in the window frame below the toolbar. Layers can
include raster and vector maps, vector labels, and commands (where any
GRASS command can be written). Layers are displayed as arranged in the layer
tree: the bottom layer is displayed first and the top layer is displayed
last, as if the layers were a series of stacked overlays.
.PP
The check box to the left of each layer makes it active or inactive
for display. Only active layers are displayed/redisplayed when the
display button is pressed. Layers can be organized into groups; entire
groups can be activated or deactivated for display. Layer tree
composition can be saved to a workspace file and opened in subsequent
sessions, restoring all layers and their display options.
.PP
A right mouse click on a layer or left clicking the button to the right of
the layer opens a dropdown menu with options to remove or rename the layer
(not the actual map), change its display properties (d.rast and d.vect
options such as color, symbol, etc.), show its metadata (r.info, v.info) or
attributes, if applicable.
.PP
A left mouse double click on a layer opens GUI for its display options
These options are those for the d.* command for each layer type (d.rast,
d.vect, or d.grid, for example).

displayed, and a statusbar with information about the geographic region of
the maps displayed.
.br
.br
.br
Figure: Map Display screenshot on Ubuntu
.PP
Each Map Display Window has a unique layer tree (in the layer manager)
and geographic \fIregion\fR setting. At the top of the window is a
toolbar with buttons to manage the map in the display (render, erase, zoom
and pan), for query and and analysis (distance measurement, profile,
and histogram creation), to overlay map elements onto the display (scale,
north arrow, legend, and custom text), and to export or print the display.
.PP
In the statusbar, the user can choose to display the geographic coordinates
under the cursor, current geographical region extent, computational region
(including graphical visualization in map display), map display geometry
(number of rows, columns, resolution) and map scale. Checking the
\fIrender\fR button in the statusbar will cause the map display to update
automatically any time a map is added to, removed from, or changed in its
layer tree.
.PP
It is important to note that zooming in any display will
have \fIno\fR effect on the \(cqcomputational region\(cq setting (set
with \fIg.region\fR). Only by selecting
the \(cqSet current region to match display\(cq item in the zoom menu (in
the map display toolbar) will the current display extents be copied to
the computational region extents.
.SS Map Display Toolbar
.IP "      \fIRe\-render display\fR" 4m
.br
Re\-renders all active map layers regardless of whether they have changed
or not, see \fId.redraw\fR.
.IP "      \fIErase display\fR" 4m
.br
Erases the currently selected map display to a white background,
see \fId.erase\fR.
.IP "      \fIPointer\fR" 4m
.br
Select arrow cursor for map display.
.IP "      \fISelect features from vector map\fR" 4m
.br
Interactively select features from given vector map. Selection
can be stored to a new vector map,
see \fIv.what\fR
and \fIv.extract\fR.
.IP "      \fIQuery raster/vector maps\fR" 4m
.br
Query selected raster, RGB raster (all three map channels will be
queried), or vector map(s) using the mouse. Map(s) must be selected
before query.  Vector charts and thematic vector maps cannot be
queried. The results of the query will be displayed in a dialog.
See \fIr.what, v.what\fR.
.IP "      \fIPan\fR" 4m
.br
Interactive selection of a new center of view in the active
display monitor. Drag the pan cursor while pressing the left mouse
button to pan.  Panning changes the location of the region displayed
but not the size of the area displayed or the resolution. Panning
does \fInot\fR affect the computational region for other GIS
processes, see \fIg.region\fR.
.IP "      \fIZoom in\fR" 4m
.br
Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active display monitor.
Drawing a box or just click with the mouse (left button) and zoom\-in
cursor causes the display to zoom in so that the area defined by the
box fills the display. The map resolution is not changed. Clicking
with the zoom\-in cursor causes the display to zoom in by 30%, centered
on the point where the mouse is clicked. Zooming resets the display
region extents (both size and location of area displayed). It
does \fInot\fR affect the computational region for other GIS
processes, see \fIg.region\fR.
.IP "      \fIZoom out\fR" 4m
.br
Interactive zooming with the mouse in the active display monitor.
Drawing a box or just click with the mouse (left button) and zoom\-out
cursor causes the display to zoom in so that the area displayed
shrinks to fill the area defined by the box. The map resolution is not
changed. Clicking with the zoom\-out cursor causes the display to zoom
out by 30%, centered on the point where the mouse is clicked. Zooming
resets the display region extents (both size and location of area
displayed). It does \fInot\fR affect the computational region for
other GIS processes,
see \fIg.region\fR.
.IP "      \fIZoom to selected map(s)\fR" 4m
.br
Set zoom extent based on selected raster or vector maps. Zooming
resets the display region extents (both size and location of area
displayed). It does \fInot\fR affect the computational region
for other GIS processes,
see \fIg.region\fR.
.IP "      \fIZoom to computational region extent\fR" 4m
.br
Set zoom extent based on the current computational region extent,
see \fIg.region\fR.
.IP "      \fIReturn to previous zoom\fR" 4m
.br
Returns to the previous zoom extent. Up to 10 levels of zoom back are
maintained, see \fIg.region\fR.
.IP "      \fIVarious zoom options\fR" 4m
.br
Opens a dropdown menu that allows user to:
.RS 4n
.IP \(bu 4n
\fIZoom to default region\fR
.IP \(bu 4n
\fIZoom to saved region\fR. Zooms to previously
saved named region.
