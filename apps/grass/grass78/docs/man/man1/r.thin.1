.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIr.thin\fR scans the named \fIinput\fR raster map layer and
thins non\-NULL cells that denote linear features into linear features
having a single cell width. Raster lines often need to be thinned
(skeletonizing raster features) to a single pixel width before they can
be transformed to vector data.
.PP
\fIr.thin\fR will thin only the non\-NULL (no data) raster cells
of the named \fIinput\fR raster map layer within the current
geographic region settings.  The cell width of the thinned
\fIoutput\fR raster map layer will be equal to the cell
resolution of the currently set geographic region.  All of
the thinned linear features will have the width of a single
cell.
.PP
\fIr.thin\fR will create a new \fIoutput\fR raster
data file containing the thinned linear features.
\fIr.thin\fR assumes that linear features are encoded
with positive values on a background of NULL\(cqs in the
\fIinput\fR raster data file, hence it creates a NULL/1
output map.
.SH NOTES
\fIr.thin\fR only creates raster map layers. In order to
create a vector map, the user will need to run
\fIr.to.vect\fR
on the resultant raster map.
.PP
\fIr.thin\fR may create small spurs or \(dqdangling lines\(dq
during the thinning process.  These spurs may be removed
(after creating a vector map layer) by
\fIv.clean\fR (\fIrmdangle\fR
tool).
.PP
This code implements the thinning algorithm described in
\(dqAnalysis of Thinning Algorithms Using Mathematical
Morphology\(dq by Ben\-Kwei Jang and Ronlad T. Chin in
\fITransactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine
Intelligence\fR, vol. 12, No. 6, June 1990.  The
definition Jang and Chin give of the thinning process is
\(dqsuccessive removal of outer layers of pixels from an
object while retaining any pixels whose removal would alter
the connectivity or shorten the legs of the sceleton.\(dq
.PP
The sceleton is finally thinned when the thinning process
converges; i.e., \(dqno further pixels can be removed without
altering the connectivity or shortening the sceleton legs\(dq
(p. 541).  The authors prove that the thinning process
described always converges and produces one\-pixel thick
sceletons.  The number of iterations depends on the
original thickness of the object.  Each iteration peels off
the outside pixels from the object.  Therefore, if the
object is <= n pixels thick, the algorithm should
converge in <= iterations.
.SH EXAMPLE
To vectorize the raster map \fIstreams_derived\fR in the North
Carolina sample dataset that represents the stream network derived from
the 10m resolution DEM by \fIr.watershed\fR, run:
.br
.nf
\fC
g.region raster=elevation \-p
# create flow accumulation map
r.watershed elevation=elevation accumulation=accum_50K thresh=50000
# extract streams from flow accumulation map
r.mapcalc \(dqstreams_from_flow = if(abs(accum_50K) > 1000, 1, null())\(dq
# skeletonize map
r.thin streams_from_flow out=streams_thin
d.mon wx0
d.rast streams_from_flow
d.erase
d.rast streams_thin
