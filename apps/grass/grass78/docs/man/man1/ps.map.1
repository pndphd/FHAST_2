.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIps.map\fR is a cartographic mapping program for producing high quality
hardcopy maps in PostScript format. Output can include a raster map, any
number of vector overlays, text labels, decorations, and other spatial data.
.PP
A file of mapping instructions that describes the various spatial and textual
information to be printed must be prepared prior to running \fIps.map\fR.
.SH NOTES
The order of commands is generally unimportant but may affect how some layers
are drawn. For example to plot \fBvpoints\fR above \fBvareas\fR list the
\fBvpoints\fR entry first. Raster maps are always drawn first, and only a
single raster map (or 3 if part of a RGB group) may be used.
.PP
The hash character (\(cq#\(cq) may be used at the beginning of a line
to indicate that the line is a comment. Blank lines will also be ignored.
.PP
Be aware that some mapping instructions require the \fIend\fR command
and some do not. Any instruction that allows subcommands will require
it, any instruction that does not allow subcommands will not.
.PP
The resolution and extent of raster maps plotted with \fIps.map\fR are
controlled by the current region settings via the
g.region module. The output filesize is largely
a function of the region resolution, so special care should be taken
if working with large raster datasets. For example if the desired output is
US\-Letter sized paper at 600dpi, with 1\(dq margins and the raster filling the
entire page, the usable area on the page will be 6.5\(dq x 9\(dq, which at 600
dots/inch is equivalent to a region of 3900 columns x 5400 rows (see
\(dqg.region \-p\(dq). Any higher resolution settings will make the
output file larger, but with a consumer printer you probably won\(cqt be able
to resolve any better detail in the hardcopy.
.PP
The user can specify negative or greater than 100 percentage values for
positioning several map decorations and embedded EPS\-files, to move them
outside the current map box region (for example to position a caption,
barscale, or legend above or below the map box).
.PP
One point (\(dqpixel\(dq) is 1/72 of an inch.
.PP
For users wanting to use special characters (such as accented characters) it
is important to note that \fIps.map\fR uses ISO\-8859\-1 encoding.
This means that your instructions file will have to be encoded in this
encoding. If you normally work in a different encoding environment (such as
UTF\-8), you have to transform your file to the ISO\-8859\-1
encoding, for example by using the iconv utility:
.br
.nf
\fC
iconv \-f UTF\-8 \-t ISO_8859\-1 utf_file > iso_file
\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
.SH MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS
The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various spatial data
to be plotted. These instructions are normally prepared in a regular
text file using a system editor. Some instructions are single line
instructions while others are multiple line. Multiple line instructions
consist of the main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
additional instructions and are terminated with an \fIend\fR instruction.

.SS Common instructions
Instructions that may be included in the subsection under several
different main instructions are:
.IP "\fBwhere\fR \fIx y\fR  " 4m
.br
The top left corner of the bounding box of the item to be plotted
is located \fIx\fR inches from the left edge of the paper and
\fIy\fR inches from the top edge of the paper. If \fIx\fR is less than
or equal to zero, the default horizontal location is used.  If \fIy\fR
is less than or equal to zero, the default vertical location is used.
.IP "\fBfont\fR \fIfont name\fR   " 4m
.br
The name of the PostScript font.
Fonts present in all PostScript implementations are:
Times\-Roman,
Times\-Italic,
Times\-Bold,
Times\-BoldItalic,
Helvetica,
Helvetica\-Oblique,
Helvetica\-Bold,
Helvetica\-BoldOblique,
Courier,
Courier\-Oblique,
Courier\-Bold,
and
Courier\-BoldOblique.
.br
The default is Helvetica.
.IP "\fBfontsize\fR \fIfont size\fR   " 4m
.br
The size of the PostScript font (in 1/72nds of an inch).
The default is 10 point.
.IP "\fBcolor\fR \fIname\fR  " 4m
.br
The following colors names are accepted by \fIps.map\fR:
aqua,
black,
blue,
brown,
cyan,
gray,
grey,
green,
indigo,
magenta,
orange,
purple,
red,
violet,
white,
yellow
\&.
.br
.br
For vectors and some plotting commands you can also specify
\(cqnone\(cq or \(cqR:G:B\(cq (e.g \(cq255:0:0\(cq).
.IP "\fByes|no\fR " 4m
.br
For options that take a yes or no answer, you can simply use the
letters \(dqy\(dq or \(dqn\(dq, or type out the full words \(dqYes\(dq or \(dqNo\(dq if you
prefer. It is not case\-sensitive. Typically the option with have a
default answer and you only need to specify one if you wish to
override it.
.PP
.br
.SS Command usage
.SH border
Controls the border which is drawn around the map area.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:  \fBborder\fR [y|n]
	\fBcolor\fR color
	\fBwidth\fR #
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
The \fBcolor\fR may be either a standard GRASS color, a R:G:B triplet,
or \(dqnone\(dq. The width is specified in points, unless followed by an \(dqi\(dq
in which case it is measured in inches.
The default is a black border box of width 1 point.
.PP
The border can be turned off completely with the
\(dqborder n\(dq instruction. In this case
the \fBend\fR command should not be given as the
main command will be treated as a single line instruction.
.PP
This example would create a grey border 0.1\(dq wide.
.br
.nf
\fC
EXAMPLE:
	\fBborder\fR
	\fBcolor\fR grey
	\fBwidth\fR 0.1i
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
.PP
.SH colortable
Prints the color table legend for the raster map layer anywhere on the page.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBcolortable\fR [y|n]
	\fBwhere\fR x y
	\fBraster\fR raster map
	\fBrange\fR minimum maximum
	\fBwidth\fR table width
	\fBheight\fR table height (FP legend only)
	\fBcols\fR table columns
	\fBfont\fR font name
	\fBfontsize\fR font size
	\fBcolor\fR text color
	\fBnodata\fR [Y|n]
	\fBtickbar\fR [y|N]
	\fBdiscrete\fR [y|n]
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
For a categorical (CELL) map the color table will create a legend displaying
the colors for each of a raster map\(cqs category values along with its
associated category label. For a floating point (FCELL or DCELL) map a
continuous gradient legend will be created.
.PP
If \fBraster\fR is omitted, the colortable defaults to the previously
registered raster layer.
.PP
The default location for the colortable is immediately below any other
map legend information, starting at the left margin.
The default text color is black.
.PP
Omitting the \fBcolortable\fR instruction would result in no color table.
If the colortable is turned off with a \(dqcolortable N\(dq
instruction the \fBend\fR command should not be given as the
main command will be treated as a single line instruction.
.PP
See also the vlegend command for creating vector map
legends.
.SS Categorical (CELL) Maps
Adding the \fBnodata N\fR instruction will prevent the \(dqno data\(dq box
from being drawn (category based legends only). If you have manually
added a \(dqno data\(dq label to the cats/ file it will be shown regardless.
.PP
\fBNote\fR:  Be careful about asking for color tables for integer
raster map layers which have many categories, such as elevation.
This could result in the printing of an extremely long color table!
In this situation it is useful to use the \fBdiscrete N\fR instruction
to force a continuous color gradient legend.
.PP
Be aware that the color table only includes categories which
have a label. You can use the \fIr.category\fR module to add labels.
.SS Floating point (FCELL and DCELL) Maps
The legend\(cqs \fBrange\fR can be adjusted for floating point rasters, but if
set beyond the extent of the map\(cqs range be sure that you have set up color
rules with \fIr.colors\fR which cover this range.
If the map has been given a data\-units label with \fIr.support\fR
then this label will be displayed.
For floating point legends \fBwidth\fR is width of color
band only. \fBheight\fR is used only for floating point legend.
A horizontal gradient legend can be achieved by setting the legend
width greater than its height.
Adding the \fBtickbar Y\fR instruction will change the tick mark style
so that ticks are drawn across the color table instead of protruding out
to the right (floating point legends only).
Adding the \fBdiscrete Y\fR instruction will command the program to treat
the map as a categorical map. In this way the legend can be created with
discrete range bands instead of a continuous gradient. You must use the
\fIr.category\fR or \fIr.support\fR module to set up the range labels
first.
.br
.PP
This example would print a color table immediately below any other map legend
information, starting at the left margin, with 4 columns:
.br
.nf
\fC
EXAMPLE:
	\fBcolortable\fR y
        \fBcols\fR 4
        \fBwidth\fR 4
        \fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
.PP
.SH comments
Prints comments anywhere on the page.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBcomments\fR commentfile
	\fBwhere\fR x y
	\fBfont\fR font name
	\fBfontsize\fR font size
	\fBcolor\fR text color
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
The default location is immediately below the last item item printed,
starting at the left margin. The default text color is black.
.PP
If you wish to use parentheses spanning multiple lines you will need to
quote them with a backslash to prevent the PostScript interpreter from
getting confused. e.g. \(cq\fB\(rs(\fR\(cq and \(cq\fB\(rs)\fR\(cq
.PP
This example prints in blue
whatever is in the file \fIveg.comments\fR starting at
1.5 inches from the left edge of the page and 7.25 inches from the top of
the page, using a 15/72 inch Helvetica Bold font.
.br
.nf
\fC
EXAMPLE:
	\fBraster\fR vegetation
	\fBcomments\fR veg.comments
	\fBwhere\fR 1.5 7.25
	\fBfont\fR Helvetica Bold
	\fBfontsize\fR 15
	\fBcolor\fR blue
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
Presumably, the file
\fIveg.comments\fR
contain comments
pertaining to the raster map layer \fIvegetation\fR,
such as \(dqThis map was created by classifying a LANDSAT TM image\(dq.
.PP
.SH copies
Specifies the number of copies to be printed.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBcopies\fR n
\fR
.fi
Each page will be printed n times.
.PP
This instruction is identical to the \fIcopies\fR command line parameter.
.PP
.SH eps
Places EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) pictures on the output map.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBeps\fR east north
	\fBeps\fR x% y%
	\fBepsfile\fR EPS file
	\fBscale\fR #
	\fBrotate\fR #
	\fBmasked\fR [y|n]
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
The EPS picture location is entered in the main
instruction line by giving either the map
coordinates or by using percentages of the geographic region.
The EPS picture will be \fIcentered\fR at the given position.
The user must specify full EPS file path \fBepsfile\fR.
The user may also specify the \fBscale\fR of the icon
(default is 1.0), the \fBrotate\fR i.e. rotation in degrees
(default is 0)
and whether the point is to be \fBmasked\fR
by the current mask.
(See manual entry for \fIr.mask\fR
for more information on the mask.)
.PP
This example would place a EPS file ./epsf/logo.eps
at the point (E456000 N7890000).  This picture would be
rotated 20 degrees clockwise, 3 times bigger than
in original file and would not be masked by the current mask.
.br
.nf
\fC
EXAMPLE:
	\fBeps\fR 456000 7890000
	\fBepsfile\fR ./epsf/logo.eps
	\fBscale\fR 3
	\fBrotate\fR 20
	\fBmasked\fR n
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
Of course, multiple EPS pictures may be drawn with multiple
\fIeps\fR
instructions.
.PP
.SH geogrid
Overlays a geographic grid onto the output map.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBgeogrid\fR spacing unit
	\fBcolor\fR color
	\fBnumbers\fR # [color]
	\fBfont\fR font name
	\fBfontsize\fR font size
	\fBwidth\fR #
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
The \fBspacing\fR and spacing unit of the geographic grid is given
on the main instruction line.  The \fBspacing\fR unit is given as one of \fBd\fR for
degrees, \fBm\fR for minutes, and \fBs\fR for seconds.
The subsection instructions allow the user to specify
the \fBcolor\fR of the geographic grid lines,
whether coordinate \fBnumbers\fR should appear
on the geographic grid lines, the \fBwidth\fR
of the lines (accepts decimal points [floating points]
as well as integers), and
if they should appear every grid line (1), every other grid line
(2), etc., and what color the numbers should be.  The defaults are
black grid lines, unnumbered.
.PP
NOTE: The \fBgeogrid\fR draws grid numbers on the east and south borders of the map.
.PP
This example would overlay a blue geographic grid with a spacing of 30 minutes
onto the output map.  Alternate grid
lines would be numbered with yellow numbers.
.br
.nf
\fC
EXAMPLE:
	\fBgeogrid\fR 30 m
	\fBcolor\fR blue
	\fBnumbers\fR 2 yellow
	\fBend\fR

.fi
.PP
.SH greyrast
Selects a raster map layer for output in shades of grey.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBgreyrast\fR mapname
\fR
.fi
For each
\fIps.map\fR
run, only one raster map layer can be requested (using either the
\fIgreyrast\fR or the \fIraster\fR instruction).
.PP
.SH grid
Overlays a coordinate grid onto the output map.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBgrid\fR spacing

	\fBcross\fR cross size
	\fBfont\fR font name
	\fBfontsize\fR font size
	\fBwidth\fR #
	\fBend\fR
\fR
.fi
The \fBspacing\fR of the grid is given (in the geographic coordinate
system units) on the main instruction line.  The subsection instructions
allow the user to specify
the \fBcolor\fR of the grid lines,
whether coordinate \fBnumbers\fR should appear
on the grid lines, and if they
should appear every grid line (1), every other grid line
(2), etc., and what color the numbers should be.
The \fBcross\fR argument draws grid intersection crosses instead of grid lines,
with cross size given in geographic coordinate system units.
The defaults are black grid lines, unnumbered.
.PP
This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of 10000 meters
(for a metered database, like UTM) onto the output map.  Alternate grid
lines would be numbered with red numbers.
.br
.nf

.PP
.SH group
Selects an RGB imagery group for output.
.br
.nf
\fC
USAGE:	\fBgroup\fR \fIgroupname\fR
\fR
.fi
This is similar to \fIraster\fR, except that it uses an imagery group
instead of a raster map layer. The group must contain three raster map
layers, comprising the red, green and blue bands of the image.
.PP
.SH header

If the \fIfile\fR sub\-instruction is absent the header will consist
of the map\(cqs title
and the location\(cqs description.
The text will be centered on the page above the map.
The default text color is black.
.PP
If the \fIfile\fR sub\-instruction is given the header will consist
of the text in the text file specified, with some special formatting keys:

The beginning and ending points of the line are entered on the main
instruction.  These points can be defined either by map coordinates or
by using percentages of the geographic region.
The user may also specify line \fBcolor\fR, \fBwidth\fR
in points (1/72\(dq; accepts decimal values as well as integers),
and if the line is to be \fBmasked\fR by the current mask.
(See manual entry for \fIr.mask
\fR for more information on the mask.)
The line \fBwidth\fR (if given) is measured in points; an \fIi\fR
directly following the number indicates that the width is given in
inches instead.
.PP
This example would draw a yellow line from the point x=10% y=80%
to the point x=30% y=70%.
This line would be 2 points wide (2/72\(dq) and would appear even if

\fBref.\fR
This reference point specifies the text handle \- what
part of the text should be placed on the location specified by the map
coordinates.  Reference points can refer to:
[lower|upper|center] [left|right|center] of the text to be printed;
The default is center center, i.e. the text is centered on the reference point.
.PP
\fBrotate\fR
sets the text rotation angle, measured in degrees counter\-clockwise.
.PP
\fByoffset\fR,
which provides finer placement of text by shifting the
text a vertical distance in points (1/72\(dq) from the specified north.
The vertical offset will shift the location to the south if positive,
north if negative;

If the \fIwhere\fR instruction is present and \fIy\fR is less than or
equal to zero, the vector legend will be positioned immediately below
the map, starting \fIx\fR inches from the left edge of the page.
.PP
\fIwidth\fR is the width in inches of the color symbol (for lines)
in front of the legend text. The default is 1/24 * fontsize inches.
.PP
\fIcols\fR is the number of columns to split the legend into. The
default is one column. The maximum number of columns is 10, or equal
to the number of legend entries if there are less than 10 entries.
.PP
\fIspan\fR is the column separation distance between the left edges of
two columns in a multicolumn legend. It is given in inches.
The default is automatic scaling based on the left margin and the right
hand side of the map box.
.PP
\fIborder\fR will draw a border around the legend using the specified color.
(see NAMED COLORS)
.PP
Alternatively, the user can create a custom legend by using the
rectangle, point, and
text instructions.
.PP
See also the colortable command for creating
raster map legends.
.PP
This example prints the vector legend
immediately below the map and starting 4.5 inches from the left edge
of the page, using a 12/72 inch Helvetica font.
