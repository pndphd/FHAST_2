Vector features can have category values in different layers. This number determines which layer to use. When used with direct OGR access this is the layer name.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIv.segment\fR generates segments or points from input lines and from
positions read from a text file or \(cqstdin\(cq. It includes the creation
of parallel lines or points in given destination from the line.
.PP
The format is:
.br
.nf
\fC
P <point id>   <line cat> <offset> [<side offset>]
L <segment id> <line cat> <start offset> <end offset> [<side offset>]
\fR
.fi
The offsets can be percent values of the line length. If the offsets are
negative, they start from the end node of the line. \-0 means the end of the
line.
.PP
The user could send to stdin something like:
.br
.nf
\fC
P 1 356 24.56
P 2 495 12.31
P 3 500 \-12.31
P 4 510 \-20%
\&...
\fR
.fi
(pipe or redirect from file into the command).
.br
.SH NOTES
A segment is only created for the first line found of the specified category.
.PP
Points are generated along the lines at the given distance(s) or percent(s)
of the line length from the beginning or end, if offsets are negative, of the
vector line.
.PP
The side offset is the orthogonal distance from the line. Positive side
offsets are to the right side of the line going forward, negative offsets
are to the left (\fId.vect\fR with \fIdisplay=shape,dir\fR shows
the direction of vector lines). As the segment distance is measured along the
original line, side\-offset lines will be longer than the start\-end segment distance
for outside corners of curving lines, and shorter for inside corners.
.PP
All offsets are measured in map units (see \(dq\fIg.proj \-p\fR\(dq) or percents
of the line length, if followed by a % character.
.PP
To place a point in the middle of a line, 50% offset can be used or the
\fIv.to.db\fR module may be used to find the line\(cqs length. Then half of
that distance can be used as the along\-line offset.
.SH EXAMPLES
The examples are based on the North Carolina sample location.
.SS Extraction of a line segment
