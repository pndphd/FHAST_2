.SH wxGUI Vector Digitizer
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvector digitizer\fR is a \fIwxGUI\fR
component intended for interactive editing and digitizing vector maps
(see \fIv.edit\fR for non\-interactive
vector editing GRASS capabilities).
.PP
Note that only vector maps stored or generated in the \fIcurrent\fR
mapset can be opened for editing.
.PP
The digitizer allows editing of 2D vector features (points, lines,
centroids, boundaries, and areas).
.PP
Vector features can be selected by mouse (bounding box or simply by
mouse click, see select threshold
in \fISettings→General→Select threshold\fR), or by query
(eg. by line length, see \fISettings→Query Tool\fR).
.SS STARTING THE DIGITIZER
The vector digitizer can be launched from Map Display toolbar by selecting
\(dqDigitize\(dq from \fITools\fR combobox. Vector map is
selectable for editing from Digitizer toolbar (\(dqSelect vector
map\(dq combobox, note that only vector maps from the current layer
tree in Layer Manager are listed).
The vector digitizer can alternatively be activated from the contextual
menu in the Layer Manager by selecting \(dqStart editing\(dq on selected vector
map in the layer tree, or directly from the Layer Manager
toolbar .
The vector digitizer also can also be launched from the command line as a
stand\-alone application \fIg.gui.vdigit\fR.
.SS CREATING A NEW VECTOR MAP
A new vector map can be easily created from the digitizer toolbar by
selecting \(dqNew vector map\(dq in \(dqSelect vector map\(dq
combobox. A new vector map is created, added to the current layer tree
in Layer Manager and opened for editing. \(dqSelect vector map\(dq
combobox in the digitizer toolbar also allows easily switching between
vector maps to be edited.
.SS EDITING AN EXISTING VECTOR MAP
An existing vector map selected in the digitizer toolbar in the
\(dqSelect vector map\(dq combobox. This map is then opened for editing
and added to the current layer tree in the \fILayer Manager\fR. This
\(dqSelect vector map\(dq combobox in the digitizer toolbar also allows
to easily switch between vector maps to be edited.
.SS USING A RASTER BACKGROUND MAP
In order to digitize from a raster map, simply load the map into the
\fIMap Display\fR using the \fILayer Manager\fR. Then start digitizing,
see below for details.
.SS USING A VECTOR BACKGROUND MAP
The vector digitizer allows you to select a \(dqbackground\(dq vector map.
Loading it within the digitizer is different from simply loading it via
\fILayer Manager\fR since direct interaction with single vector features
then becomes possible.
.br
Vector features may be copied from the background map by \(dqCopy features from
(background) vector map\(dq tool from the \(dqAdditional tools\(dq of the
digitizer toolbar.
Newly digitized vector features are snapped in the given threshold to the features
from the background map.

.RS 4n
.IP \(bu 4n
\fIBreak selected lines/boundaries at intersection\fR
.br
Split
given vector line or boundary into two lines on given position
(based on \fIv.clean\fR,
tool=break).
.IP \(bu 4n
\fIConnect two selected lines/boundaries\fR

.SH NOTES
.IP "\fBMouse button functions:\fR" 4m
.br
.IP "\fILeft\fR   \- select or deselect features" 4m
.IP "\fIControl+Left\fR \- cancel action or undo vertex when digitizing lines" 4m

.PP
\fIDead (deleted)\fR features are only marked as \(cqdead\(cq in the geometry file
but remain there and occupy space. Any vector module
used afterwards on this vector map which really reads and writes
vector geometry (so not \fIg.copy\fR)
will write only features which are \(cqalive\(cq.
.PP
\fIAdded or modified\fR vector features are \fIsnapped\fR to
existing vector features (Settings→General→Snapping). To
disable snapping set the snapping threshold to \(cq0\(cq.
.PP
If the digitizer crashes for some reason, the changes are
automatically saved. Broken topology can be repaired by running
\fIv.build\fR.
.PP
GRASS GIS uses a topological vector format, meaning that a common boundary of
two polygons is only stored once. When digitizing polygons it is thus important
to be able to only draw each boundary once. When drawing a polygon adjacent to an
existing polygon, one has to first split the existing boundary at the points where
the new boundary will be attached. Snapping should be set to ensure that the new
boundaries are automatically attached to the chosen points.
