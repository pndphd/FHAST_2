.SH Display drivers
The current command line rendering mechanism is direct rendering into
a file. The driver is selected by setting
the GRASS_RENDER_IMMEDIATE variable or by
running \fId.mon\fR module.

.SS GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND
If environmental variable GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND is defined,
rendering is redirected by display library to the given external command
defined by this variable. Currently only Python scrips are supported.
.PP
Lets start with simple example of Python script called \fIrender.py\fR:
.br
.nf
\fC
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import sys
import grass.script as grass
from grass.script import task as gtask
os.environ[\(cqGRASS_RENDER_IMMEDIATE\(cq] = \(cqdefault\(cq
os.environ[\(cqGRASS_RENDER_FILE\(cq] = \(cqoutput.png\(cq
cmd, dcmd = gtask.cmdstring_to_tuple(sys.argv[1])
grass.run_command(\(cqd.text\(cq, text=\(dqTest of GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND redirection\(dq)
os.environ[\(cqGRASS_RENDER_FILE_READ\(cq] = \(cqTRUE\(cq
grass.run_command(cmd, **dcmd)
\fR
.fi
After defining GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND variable (example for Bash):
.br
.nf
\fC
export GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND=render.py
\fR
.fi
Display GRASS modules like \fId.rast\fR
or \fId.vect\fR will be executed
by \fIrender.py\fR program.
For example the command
.br
.nf
\fC
d.vect roadsmajor
\fR
.fi
produces output PNG file \fIoutput.png\fR which will contain rendered
features from vector map \fIroadsmajor\fR and sample text \fI\(dqTest of
GRASS_RENDER_COMMAND redirection\(dq\fR.
