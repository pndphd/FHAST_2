.SH PostScript DISPLAY DRIVER
\fIPS display driver\fR to create PostScript files.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The PS driver generates a PostScript file from GRASS display commands.
.SH USAGE
.SS Environment variables
The PS driver can be enabled by setting \fBGRASS_RENDER_IMMEDIATE\fR
variable, eg.
.br
.nf
\fC
export GRASS_RENDER_IMMEDIATE=ps
\fR
.fi
Several environment variables affect the operation of the PS driver:
.RS 4n
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_WIDTH=xxx\fR
.br
the width of the image map (default is 640).
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_HEIGHT=yyy\fR
.br
the height of the image map (default is 480).
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_TRUECOLOR=[TRUE|FALSE]\fR
.br
sets true\-color support. Default is FALSE.
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_FILE\fR
.br
name of output file. If it ends with \(dq.eps\(dq an EPS file
will be created.
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_PS_PAPER\fR
.br
sets the screen dimensions and margins to
fit a standard paper size, see also GRASS_RENDER_WIDTH, GRASS_RENDER_HEIGHT.
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_PS_LANDSCAPE\fR
.br
if TRUE, the screen is rotated 90 degrees
counter\-clockwise so that a \(dqlandscape\(dq screen fits better on
\(dqportrait\(dq paper.
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_PS_HEADER\fR
.br
if FALSE, the output is appended to any existing file,
and no prolog or setup sections are generated.
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBGRASS_RENDER_PS_TRAILER\fR
.br
if FALSE, no trailer section is generated.
.RE
.SS Example
.br
.nf
\fC
export GRASS_RENDER_IMMEDIATE=ps
export GRASS_RENDER_TRUECOLOR=TRUE
g.region raster=elevation
d.rast elevation
d.vect roadsmajor color=red
\fR
.fi
This writes a file named map.ps in your current directory.
.SH NOTES
The resolution of the output files is defined by current region
extents. Use g.region \-p to get the number of rows and cols
and use the environment variables to set the image size. If you would
like a larger image, multiply both rows and cols by the same whole
number to preserve the aspect ratio.
.PP
GRASS_RENDER_TRUECOLOR requires either PostScript level 2 or level 1 plus the
colorimage and setrgbcolor operators (this is the case for colour
printers which pre\-date level 2 PostScript).
.PP
Masked images (d.rast, d.rgb, d.his \-n)
require PostScript level 3.
