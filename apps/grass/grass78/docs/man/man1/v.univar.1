.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIv.univar\fR calculates univariate statistics on (by default) an attribute
of, or, through the \fB\-d\fR flag on distance between, vector map features.
Attributes are read per feature and per category value. This means that if the
map contains several features with the same category value, the attribute is
read as many times as there are features. On the other hand, if a feature has
more than one category value, each attribute value linked to each of the
category values of the feature is read. For statistics on one attribute
per category value, instead of one attribute per feature and per category,
see v.db.univar.
.PP
Extended statistics (\fB\-e\fR) adds median, 1st and 3rd quartiles, and 90th
percentile to the output.
.SH NOTES
When using the \fB\-d\fR flag, univariate statistics of distances
between vector features are calculated. The distances from all features
to all other features are used. Since the distance from feature A to
feature B is the same like the distance from feature B to feature A,
that distance is considered only once, i.e. all pairwise distances
between features are used. Depending on the selected vector
\fBtype\fR, distances are calculated as follows:
.RS 4n
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBtype=point\fR: point distances are considered;
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBtype=line\fR: line to line distances are considered;
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBtype=area\fR: not supported, use \fBtype=centroid\fR instead (and see
v.distance for calculating distances
between areas)

.SH EXAMPLES
The examples are based on the North Carolina sample dataset.
