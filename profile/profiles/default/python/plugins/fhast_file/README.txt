Plugin Builder Results

Your plugin FHASTFile was created in:
    C:/Users/pndph/Desktop/Temp/FHAST_1/profile/profiles/default/python/plugins\fhast_file

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    C:/Users/pndph/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc5

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``fhast_file.py``

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

  * Modify your user interface by opening FHASTFile_dialog_base.ui in Qt Designer

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
