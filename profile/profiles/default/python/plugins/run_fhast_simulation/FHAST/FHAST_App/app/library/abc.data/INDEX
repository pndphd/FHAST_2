human                   A set of R objects containing observed data
                        from three human populations, and simulated
                        data under three different demographic models.
                        The data set is used to illustrate model
                        selection and parameter inference in an ABC
                        framework (see the vignette of the 'abc'
                        package for more details).
musigma2                A set of objects used to estimate the
                        population mean and variance in a Gaussian
                        model with ABC (see the vignette of the 'abc'
                        package for more details).
ppc                     Data to illustrate the posterior predictive
                        checks for the data 'human'. 'ppc' and 'human'
                        are used to illustrate model selection and
                        parameter inference in an ABC framework (see
                        the vignette of the 'abc' package for more
                        details).
